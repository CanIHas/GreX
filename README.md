# Latex

Sometimes you need to implement some method, and you would like to research it a little.
You'll need some framework for running experiments in which you'd like to try out different parameter values.
Result persistence may be really important, if your experiments take some time.
Then, you'd like to sum your results in some paper. You'd probably use LaTeX, so you'll need
data table structures, together with possibility of dumping them to LaTeX format.
So, why not go further? Here I am, trying to provide those LaTeX possibilities that I know (I'm quite a newbie
to LaTeX, unfortunately) in form of Groovy library with builder API, together with some LaTeX document data model.
